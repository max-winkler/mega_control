# MeGa-Control

## Description

This is a Matlab implmentation for the solution of PDEs and optimal control problems on metric graphs.

## Structure
```
./core/ - The core components of the algorithms (assembly of FE matrices, plotting, ...)
./graphs/ - Some example graphs
```
## Usage

Several examples on the computation of a PDE or an optimal control problem can be found in the base directory.
